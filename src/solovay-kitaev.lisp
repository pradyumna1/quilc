;;; This file contains an implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev
;;; algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0505030.pdf,
;;; used to approximately decompose arbitrary unitaries using a finite
;;; set of basis gates.

;;; In the rest of this file, d(x, y) refers to the function of
;;; operator distance defined in the above paper and is equal to ||X -
;;; Y||, the operator norm of (X - Y).

;;; Constant that upper bounds the ratio between d(V, I) [or d(W, I)]
;;; and sqrt(d(U, I)) if V and W are balanced group commutators of U
;;; [found on page 8 of the paper]. 0.9 is a value obtained
;;; numerically through testing gc-decompose on random unitaries.
(defparameter +c-gc+ 0.9)
;;; Constant that upper bounds the ratio between d(VWV'W', approximate
;;; VWV'W') and eps^(3/2), for the balanced group commutators V, W of
;;; a unitary and the eps-approximation of each commutator [eps = d(V,
;;; approximate V) = d(W, approximate W)]. It is also assumed that
;;; d(V, I) = d(W, I) < c-gc * sqrt(eps), which is true for group
;;; commutator decompositions made inside the SK-algorithm. [found on
;;; page 9 of the paper]

;;; This should theoretically be approximately equal to (* 8 +c-gc+),
;;; but as the paper's authors have shown, a c-approx as low as 2.67
;;; can work in practice [yielding a base approximation distance of
;;; 1/c-approx^2 = 0.14]. We'll use that for now.

;;; The general procedure here is to use what I call the "angle-axis
;;; ball" mapping of SU(2) (technically PU(2), the group of SU(2)
;;; modulo global phase). A unitary which is a rotation about an axis
;;; in 3d space by an angle theta is mapped to a point of radius theta
;;; in the direction of the rotation axis; thus, the entire group is
;;; mapped to a ball of radius pi. The Euclidean distance between
;;; points in the angle-axis ball is not perfectly correlated with our
;;; desired metric of operator distance, but is related closely enough
;;; to serve as a surprisingly good heuristic. It is also much more
;;; convenient to work with than a 3-sphere, which is a big reason for
;;; why I'm using this.

;;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Overall procedure taken in https://github.com/cmdawson/sk to find
;;; balanced group commutators V and W for a unitary U (the ' symbol
;;; represents a dagger):
;;;
;;;    1) Convert U to its bloch-vector representation, which is a
;;;       rotation by some theta around an arbitrary axis.
;;;
;;;    2) Find unitaries S and Rx s.t. Rx is a rotation around the X
;;;       axis by theta and SRxS' = U.
;;;
;;;    3) Find the group commutators B, C for Rx s.t. Rx = BCB'C'.
;;;
;;; With A, B, and S, we can set V = SBS' and W = SCS', because then
;;; VWV'W' = SBS'SCS'SB'S'SC'S' = SBCB'C'S' = SRxS' = U.
